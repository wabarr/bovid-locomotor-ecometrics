# bovid-locomotor-ecometrics

This repository includes R code and data used for a paper in review in the journal *Evolutionary Ecology Research*

The ecometric dataset used is [here](https://github.com/wabarr/bovid-locomotor-ecometrics/blob/master/all_ecomorphic_data.csv)

You can see the whole analysis [here](https://github.com/wabarr/bovid-locomotor-ecometrics/blob/master/bovid-ecometrics-EER-code.md). 

**Note:** the precipitation and land cover rasters required to run this analysis are too large for github and are available upon request from the author
